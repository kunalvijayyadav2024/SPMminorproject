This repository contains the NewsPaper Application System:

## Projects
- **NewsPaperAPI** — Backend REST API built with ASP.NET Core and SQLite.
- **NewsPaperWebApp** — Frontend web application that consumes the NewsPaperAPI endpoints.

### How it works
The WebApp communicates with the API (e.g., via `https://localhost:5001/api/news`) to display articles and manage users.

---

### To Run Locally:
1. Start **NewsPaperAPI** (Backend)
2. Start **NewsPaperWebApp** (Frontend)
3. The WebApp will fetch data from the API.
